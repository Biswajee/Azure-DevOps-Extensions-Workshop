## Prerequisites

The workshop assumes that you know and have access to the following resources:

- [x] Javascript/Typescript
- [x] Sinon, Mocha, Chai testing
- [x] Node.js
- [x] GNU Make
- [x] [Azure DevOps Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)

## Preparing the extension

### Setup the workspace

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) using your personal microsoft account.

2. Create an organization. You can provide any name, make sure it's a unique one.

3. Create 2 projects by clicking the `New Project` button.

    - The first project will hoist your extension-code and release pipeline.

    - The purpose of the second project is to demonstrate that extension tasks are avalable cross-organization.

4. Create a repository in the first project space for your extension code.

5. We'll need to install the necessary [Azure DevOps Extension Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vsts-developer-tools-build-tasks) by Microsoft installed to build and release azure devops extensions.

    - _Install the extension._

    - _Check if the extension is correctly installed by visiting <OrganizationName> -> Organization settings -> Extensions._

6. Clone the repository code and delete the current git remote using below steps.
(We will upload the same code to the azure repository).

    ```shell
    # Git clone the repository
    https://github.com/Biswajee/Azure-DevOps-Extensions-Workshop.git

    # Remove the remote url for the cloned repo
    git remote remove origin

    # Add the new remote url from your azure devops extension repository
    git remote add origin https://<OrganizationName>@dev.azure.com/<OrganizationName>/<ProjectName>/_git/<AzureRepositoryName>
    git push -u origin --all
    ```

7. Check whether the code you've pushed got successfully updated in the azure devops respository.

Horray! You've completed the first subtask ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Setup the marketplace service connection

1. Go to the project space where your extension repository is present.

2. `[User Settings]` > `[Personal access tokens]` > `[ + New Token]`.

    ![User settings location](./demo-images/user-settings.png)

3. `[Project Settings]` > `[Service Connections]` > `[Create Service Connection]`.

4. In the search bar, find **Visual Studio Marketplace**. Click Next.

5. Add your personal access token that you copied.

6. Provide the name of the service connection and an optional description.

7. Make sure the **Grant access permission to all pipelines** is checked âœ….

_Please note the name of the service connection after creating._

### Create the publisher

1. Go to the [publish your extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/createpublisher?managePageRedirect=true) page and create a publisher. Please note the **publisher ID** after creating.

_(Any details other than the name of the publisher and the publsher id are optional.)_

### Setup the Azure DevOps Pipeline

The Azure DevOps pipeline is located at the root of the project
[here](./az-build-and-release-pipeline.yaml).
Please update the values in the variable section of the pipeline (Line 19 to 29) as under:

```yaml
variables:
  # the publisher id you've created
  publisherId: <YOUR-PUBLISHER-ID>
  # the value of url after https://dev.azure.com/<YOUR-ORGANIZATION-NAME>
  shareWithOrganization: <YOUR-ORGANIZATION-NAME>
  # example of organization url: https://dev.azure.com/biswajitr
  shareWithOrganization.URLs: <YOUR-ORGANIZATION-URL> 
  # the name of the marketplace service connection that you've created
  marketplaceServiceConnectionName: <YOUR-MARKETPLACE-SERVICE-CONNECTION>
```

Now, we're ready to create our first pipeline ðŸŽ‰

1. Click the pipelines icon in the azure devops platform.

2. Click on `[ New Pipeline ]` button.

3. Select following responses when prompted:
  - Where is your code: Azure Repos Git
  - Select a repository: <YOUR-REPOSITORY>
  - Configure your pipeline: Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file
  - Enter pipeline path as: /az-build-and-release-pipeline.yaml

Click continue to setup your pipeline.

Review your pipeline YAML and hit run to execute the pipeline.
